The Coderwall module provides integration with the Coderwall service, allowing
you to display Coderwall achievements on your site.

Coderwall provides both a block, suitable for a personal website, which may be
configured with a single, global coderwall username. This will provide badges for the configured username.

In addition it provides a user profile field for a coderwall username which will
provide the badges for each user so configured.
